    "text": "Summary\nFootball recruitment is about finding exceptional talents that fit into your team style. Often we try and find similar players to a player we like. But is there anyone like fan favourite Kevin De Bruyne? Here I instead find players that stand out, the outliers. These outliers may flag up a few exceptional talents for you to look at in your scouting process.\n\n\nIntroducing outlier analysis\nMost of the public football recruitment analysis tends to fall into three camps. Given a good player, could you find me a player with a similar style? Visualizations that show a fixed set of skills for a position, e.g. Radars. Scatter plots that show extreme values in one or two traits.\nI got interested in the last approach via a thread by @MishraAbhiA. Yet, I am not satisfied with cherry-picking data and identifying a handful of players. Can we do better and scale this type of approach to look at many skills?\nOutlier analysis is perfect for this. We use it in the industry to detect faulty machinery if we observe unusual sensor readings. Here we can take many skills and identify players where their mix of skills is unusual instead. We find these unique players via machine learning.\n\n\nWhat is an outlier?\nAn outlier is a player where their skills are far away from the other players. Robert Lewandowski scored 11 more goals than his nearest competitor Messi in 2020-21. He is a clear outlier in the big five leagues, according to FBRef.\n\n“Recruitment is all about outliers.

All the code for this blog is open-source in my Github repo. The recipe for detecting outliers is:\n\nDownload data from FBRef of the big-5 leagues for the last three seasons (2018-19, 2019-20 & 2020-21).\nCombine the player data so that there is one line per player. Create totals for each statistic over the last three years. Recalculate statistics such as percentages, ratios, and averages from the raw data.\nDownload Transfermarkt data and fuzzy match to the FBRef data.\nExclude players who played zero minutes for a team during 2020-21 in the big-5 leagues.\nExclude players who played fewer than 675 minutes (approx 7.5 games) over the last three seasons.\nExclude players who play at centre-back or goalkeeper. You might want to run your own analysis on these positions.\nDrop some columns that we do not want to use for outlier detection, such as yellow cards or penalties. My choice here is the number of cards does not matter. I also do not want to identify a player for taking rare set pieces.\nRemove correlated features. I want to make it harder to identify players who rate high in several correlated skills. For example, Jack Grealish excels in many skills related to dribbles and carries. As I keep fewer of these skills in the data, it is harder to identify him as an outlier via dribbles only.\nAdd a column for the player’s position. You might instead want to make different models for each player position. I let the model decide whether the player position was an important feature.\nChange the bottom 40-50% for each statistic so that all the players near the bottom have the same value. I don’t want to flag people as outliers for their poor figures.\nUse the isolation forests algorithm from sci-kit to identify outliers. Use SHAP values to identify the top contributors to the outlier score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIsolation forests scores each football player for their uniqueness. It builds several trees which randomly split the players by a random statistic, such as expected goals. The fewer splits required to isolate a player, the more likely the player is an outlier.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nA large majority of a player’s time in football is off the ball.

    "text": "A Neutral Strategy, but Attacking Throw-Ins Show Promise\n\n\n\n\nThis blog explores whether football (soccer) players should launch long balls into touch in the final third, conceding possession for a throw-in but gaining territorial advantage.\nOn average, this strategy is neutral. Any advantage of being more likely to take the next shot as you’re closer to the opposition goal is offset by the risk of facing counter-attacks with higher quality shot opportunities compared to what your team would have generated.\nOn the other hand, if your team wins an attacking throw in the final third, it results in a positive expected goals (xG) difference (+0.014 per throw-in).\n\n\n\n\nShould Players Launch a Long Ball into Touch, Conceding a Throw-in?\nInspired by rugby tactics, I investigated whether football players should employ a strategy of launching long balls into touch. This approach concedes possession via an opponent’s throw-in but positions the ball closer to the opposition’s goal. For this analysis, I utilized the Hudl StatsBomb open-data set from the 2015/16 season, covering the men’s “Big-5” leagues (the top divisions in England, Italy, France, Spain, and Germany).\n\n\nThe Strategy is Neutral\nLaunching a long ball into touch is, on average, a neutral strategy.\n\nLaunching the ball into the final third touch means your team is more likely to take the next shot than your opponent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, if your opponent retains possession from their resulting throw-in, they tend to create higher quality shot opportunities compared to what your team would have generated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe higher shot quality of your opponent effectively negates any territorial gain from launching the ball. On average, this results in a neutral Expected Goals (xG) difference (approximately zero) from launching the ball into touch. Interestingly, an attacking throw-in in the final third does result in a positive xG difference (0.014 per throw-in).\n\nIn this analysis, I build on goal difference, and define xG difference as the sum of xG from the team taking the throw-in minus the sum of xG from the team defending the throw-in. A negative xG difference would suggest it’s advantageous to kick the ball into touch and defend the throw-in, as the team taking the throw-in would, on average, concede more goals than they score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this analysis, I matched data from approximately 79,000 throw-ins to the next shot in the game period (excluding about 6,000 throw-ins without a subsequent shot). It’s important to note that the data is ten years old, potentially missing recent advances in advances in set piece tactics and pressing strategies employed by teams.\n\n\nSummary: A Neutral Strategy, but Attacking Throw-Ins Show Promise\nWhile launching the ball into touch doesn’t appear to be a viable strategy on average, there may be exploitable positional lineups, pressing systems, or specific circumstances that could make this strategy effective and counter the risk of conceding higher-quality shots. However, even a decade ago, attacking throw-ins in the final third showed potential for gains. As Ted Knutson notes in the Transfer Flow podcast, throw-ins offer three distinct advantages over open play passes:\n\nyou cannot be offside.\nyou can plan mismatches and overloads.\nthe player taking the throw in can see all the players on the pitch."
